Atlas Generator (C/C++/libPNG)
An implementation of a png sprite sheet atlas generator.

I used Randy Gaul's implementation of his Atlas Generator in his SEL engine 
as a basis for my implementation.

Goals for this Project:
1) Learn about png files. How they are used/implemented.
2) Learn how to use the libpng library for basic reading/writing of png files.
3) Have fun. Make something cool that I could possibly use in the future when I
	make some games.
